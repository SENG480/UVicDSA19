# Spyder: Scientific Python IDE
The documentation is written on Spyder IDE for SENG 480 instructed by Dr. Neil Ernst during the Winter 2019 semester at the University of Victoria, and is written by Arman Yousef Zadeh Shooshtari, Anna Olkhovskaia, ZoÃ« Henderson, Alex Deweert, and Nitika Jindal.

The Spyder Integrated Development Environment (Spyder) is an open source cross-platform development environment for scientific programming in the Python language. Spyder integrates with a number of prominent packages in the scientific Python stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, IPython, SymPy and Cython.

Spyder is a free and open source IDE first released in 2009. Previously known as "Pydee", the project started as a port of spyderlib, which is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. Spyder offers a unique combination of advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality. It is a comprehensive development tool with data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities. Beyond its many built-in features, its abilities can be extended even further via its plugin system and API. Furthermore, Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing developers to build upon its functionality and embed its components, such as the interactive console, in their own PyQt software. [1.1]

This documentation will serve to highlight some of the key architectural features of Spyder which support some of the business drivers behind the Spyder Project. First, the documentation will highlight the key stakeholders of the project and their business goals. From these goals a list of architecturally significant requirements are derived, and then the quality attribute scenarios which detail quantitative measurements of how the architecturally significant requirements can be realized. A primary presentation of the overall architecture of Spyder, plus two interface diagrams, a context diagram, and two sequence diagrams will provide some insight into the operations of Spyder at both macro and micro levels of abstraction. Later, a component and connector diagram will provide even more detail into one of the key design decisions about how Spyder translates user GUI events into code execution and the subsequent display of rendered images. The component and connector view also provides another context diagram which summarizes the interaction between the Spyder CodeEditor and the external kernels which process code cells and update the image canvas for rendering. The documentation discusses how Spyder responds to variability in its environment, and to internal changes of architecture as well. Finally, the documentation attempts to analyze the rationale behind some of the key design decisions for the Spyder project.

## Business Goals

### Financial

Spyder is seeking an initial contribution goal of $7,000 USD in order to fund baseline development activities which include finishing Spyder 4 and hiring a part-time junior developer [1.7].

Spyder is seeking a long term sponsorship goal of $35,000 USD per year in order to match the previous funding of Anaconda and take on four part-time developers [1.7].

Spyder developers continue to seek support from the community to reach the level of funding by releasing new donation tiers and rewards in order to make the release of new features for Spyder 4 possible [1.7].

### Managing the quality and reputation of products

For the Spyder IDE project, the Spyder contributor community desires that the project continue to be starred and forked by the Github community, thereby increasing potential sponsorship and contributor numbers, directly affecting the quality of the product. In addition, the Spyder contributor community desires to provide the best Scientific Python Development Environment possible [1.8].

For the Spyder IDE project, the Spyder contributor community desires a maintained and possibly increased rate of commits, bug fixes, pace of development, and new features. This goal can be measured by comparing levels of future commits to the average based on the numbers between November 2017 through May 2018 [1.9].

## Privacy and Ethics Concerns

### Introduction

There are numerous considerations to make when conducting a privacy and ethics analysis of a software project. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) provides an excellent Code of Ethics, lending itself to guide such an analysis, and steering a software development project in the right direction. While reading over the documentation, wiki, and the project website for the Spyder Python IDE (Spyder), it was discovered that a specific policy or code of ethics of their own was not present. It was left to the authors of this document to make conclusions based on a combination of references to the ACM and the existing documentation and code for Spyder. However, there are many boilerplate [1.2] licenses within the Spyder Github repository. This indicates that the developer group is concerned, at least in part, with legal use and distribution of their software. In addition, extensive copyright agreements exist within the repository within 3rd party libraries and frameworks, as well as Spyder proprietary software.

### Potential Privacy and Security Concerns

Within the Spyder Github code, there is a partially boilerplate MIT style license which permits commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use of their product. Moreover, this license absolves Spyder Project Contributors, at least in part, of any liability under the categories claim, damages, or âother.â This is not, of course, a direct indication that the Spyder Project Contributors themselves are purposely making their software available for malicious or negligent use. However, we still must consider that the developers of the project do not hold themselves liable for any use of the product. Such a consideration is relevant given that Spyder could possibly be used for either a safety or infrastructure related purpose. Of course, these are only speculative considerations for the purposes of this assignment.

Given the open source nature of this project, we must consider that any software utilized on the internet carries with it an inherent danger surrounding privacy issues. Consider one simple example where Notepad++ was âhijackedâ by a United States government agency to have access to the content of files written on Notepad++ [1.11]. Since this project is open source, then itâs mechanics are even more subject to potential analysis and subsequent exploitation by outside parties. Another such example occurred during malicious use of the Dolphin video game emulator [1.5, 1.6], allowing arbitrary code execution through disc images; it is clear that open source code is not always just viewed or referenced, but used to design nefarious exploits.

### Ethical Dilemmas

It is not immediately obvious that Spyder Project Contributors are subject to any kind of explicit agreement to guide project contributions. There is an open invitation to anybody who wants to contribute the project, but neither contribution nor ethical guidelines could not be located [1.1]. Granted, any code that is submitted is done so via pull request, so the primary contributors and administrators of the Spyder code base presumably will check for malicious or poorly written code. The dilemma here is that anybody who makes a contribution to the Spyder code base is under no apparent set of guiding principles, or, under the kind of scrutiny that somebody in a private sector development job might be under. In addition, an open source contributor has lower stakes on which to base their reputation and livelihood on considering that contributions are done anonymously absent a threat of being fired or ostracised.

An ethical dilemma could arise if a 3rd party company makes significant monetary gains following use of the Spyder product either through direct use of the product, or by a redistribution and possible rebranding. Considering that there exists an extensive use and licensing document present on the Spyder project Github site [1.2], these rules appear to be for both end users of Spyder, and for developers of Spyder who contribute to the project. Clearly, failure to abide by these rules could result in some legal action based on an oversight of ethical software development and/or business practices.

One particular point in the ACM mentions fair treatment of groups or individuals regardless of their race, community, gender, or general orientation. Any large-scale open source project is certainly subject to public scrutiny with regards to ethical consideration surrounding such unfair treatment. A negative outcry or investigation based on such conflicts of interest might affect the business goals of Spyder [1.4].

## Summary

Regarding the ACM General Ethical Principles (in particular to avoid harm, to be fair, taking action not to discriminate, respecting privacy, respecting the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts), initial perusal of the documentation and issues forums seems to indicate that Spyder IDE community adheres to these principles [1.3,1.10].

Regarding section 3.7 of the ACM (to recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society), considering that applications written in Spyder utilize the underlying architecture and design decisions of the Spyder IDE global contributors, we believe that the overall quality of code of the project must be strongly considered in order to determine whether this guideline is adhered to or not. This may or may not be ascertained following more extensive documentation of this project later on in the course. At this early stage, however, an in depth product quality analysis based on understanding Spyder architecture is not immediately obvious, and may be weighed in upon at another time.

# Architecturally Significant Requirements

1. Upon closing the Spyder IDE, the userâs work must be saved at least once. In the event of a system or software crash, saved versions of the most recently changed documents can be restored from an automatic backup, so the Spyder IDE must backup unsaved files at regular intervals.
2. The Spyder IDE should be able to show syntactic errors in a way that the programmer can easily understand the cause of the error.
3. Spyder must be able to run on different operating systems.
4. Spyder must be able to support most recent versions of Python.
5. Spyder should be able to run on a wide variety of hardware.
6. Updates to the Spyder IDE should allow previous Spyder project compatibility assuming that the project is reasonably recent.
7. Spyder must capture and handle user program or Spyder tool failures by generating comprehensive bug, error, and exception reports
8. Spyder must draw graphs, diagrams, and execute code with low latency.
9. A user must be able to easily debug and trace their code in the Spyder IDE using debugging, tracing, and breakpoint tools.
10. A code-completion aid feature similar to Microsoft IntelliSense should available as a tool in Spyder IDE.

## Quality Attribute Scenarios

| Quality Attributes | Attribute Refinement | Scenarios |
|------|--------|--------|
| Performance | Runtime Latency | A user wishes to graph a three-dimensional dataset at the Large Hadron Collider based on particle acceleration and collision. Since these datasets are notoriously very large, the user is skeptical that the graph will render quickly, but is happy to discover that data processing and rendering is relatively fast (H M).|
| Security | Data Integrity | A user works on a large piece of code for an hour having saved once at the beginning, the power goes out and the user attempts to recover lost work. The user finds that 98% of their code is still available due to the automatic backup system (H L). |
| Usability | Syntax error comprehension | A user writes code that has > 50 syntax errors, the errors are shown to the user by caution symbol on the affected lines so they can easily identify their errors (H M). |
| | Runtime error comprehension | A new user unfamiliar with python is experimenting with their code, upon running it the IDE comprehensive informs them of the errors in such a way that they can easily trace their errors (H M).|
| | Debugging and Tracing | A developer is creating a complex program that has a difficult runtime error. The user is unable to find the error by simply tracing the code, so the user adds a breakpoint so that execution is halted, and the variable states can be examined. The user easily determines how the values of the variables are changing in the flow of the code which causes the runtime error (H M). |
| | Template Based Completion | A developer is writing many classes with similarly structure code, each of which will require customized tweaks based on a boilerplate style of initial design, but cannot be compressed into a single class. To save time, the user presses a combination of keys to activate the code-completion feature and is able to select from a saved list of code template (H H). |
| Accessibility | Syntax Colouring | A user is colorblind. Spyder supports changing syntax highlighting to a user-defined color palette (M L). |
| | Key Mapping | A user has motor control issues. Spyder supports remapping keyboard shortcuts, which can act as an aid for some people (M L). |
| Maintainability | Modularity | A developer wants to add features; Spyder's loose coupling allows them modify, add, and swap components without headache (M H). |

## Primary Presentation

This view implements the "uses" style of module views. Here we present the overall architecture of the Spyder IDE with a focus on three specific aspects of the architecture which highlight its plugin widget system for extensibility, and two quality attribute scenarios from Milestone 2.

And the scenarios are:

1. A developer is writing many classes with similarly structure code, each of which will require customized tweaks based on a boilerplate style of initial design, but cannot be compressed into a single class. To save time, the user presses a combination of keys to activate the code-completion feature and is able to select from a saved list of code template. (Intellisense).
2. A user works on a large piece of code for an hour having saved once at the beginning, the power goes out and the user attempts to recover his/her lost work. The user finds that 98% of their code is still available due to the automatic backup system.

## Element Catalogue

### spyder

Spyder is the main outer package which contains all the business logic for the Spyder IDE project. Almost all of the important logic with respect to the functionality of the entire IDE is contained in this package. It is an all-encompassing package at the root level of the project which includes version control, scripting, and continuous integration packages as well. It provides functionality such as opening, editing, and saving files which contain code or text.

### spyder.plugins

The plugins package contains the code for plugin modules which are appended to the primary spyder base code. Spyder works on the basis of adding plugins for additional IDE functionality, which is good design since it keeps the code modular and extensible. These plugins include such modules as editor, console, breakpoints, explorer, etc. For example, the editor is the window where one would write code. The console would be a docked or floating window where one would see program output from the stdout or stderr output streams.

### spyder.plugins.editor

This is a package which contains the editor plugin. The editor is the main window within which a developer would edit code. The package also contains the code for the editor API itself, which would allow outside modules to communicate with an editor object or to call editor functions.

### spyder.plugins.editor.Editor

This is a class within the plugin.py file that contains most of the base logic for an editor widget. This class also contains the functions that handle file autosaving for both individual editors and stacks of editors.

### spyder.plugins.editor.utils

This is a package which contains the code for utilities for the editor plugin. For example, autosave, debugging, folding, etc. This package also contains testing for these utilities as well as the code for initialization.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp

This package contains all of the code that handles the spyder Language Server Protocol client implementations. This also includes the ZMQ/TCP proxy classes (under the transport package) which act as an intermediary between the Spyder LSPClient and the LanguageServerClient.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.LSPClient

This class acts as a client for communication with the LanguageServerClient via ZMQ and implements the calls and procedures required to communicate with a v3.0 Language Server Protocol server (via ZMQ).

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.LSPManager

This class manages all LSPClients connected to language servers defined in the preferences of the Spyder project.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.transport

This package contains the implementation code for the ZMQ/TCP proxy classes which are run independently from the main Spyder program.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.transport.main

This module isnât a class, rather it acts as an entry point for the ZMQ/Proxy system, initializing a LanguageServerClient and, by extension the requisite ZMQ incoming and outgoing ports for communication with LSPClients.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.transport.LanguageServerClient

This class handles incoming requests from the actual Spyder LSP client ZMQ queue, encapsulates them into valid JSONRPC messages and sends them to an LSP server via TCP.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.transport.IncomingMessageThread

This class handles and processes incoming TCP messages sent by a Language Server Protocol server, then it relays the information to the actual Spyder LSP client via ZMQ.

### zmq

ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications. Spyder uses ZMQ for communication with a ZMQ/TCP proxy system which relays requests to a Language Server (via TCP) in order to facilitate Intellisense like functionality such as code completion, code insights, and definitions.

### zmq.Context

Contexts help manage any sockets that are created as well as the number of threads ZeroMQ uses behind the scenes. ZMQ handles the creation and destruction of sockets when processes are started and terminated. Contexts can be shared between threads and, in fact, are the only ZeroMQ objects that can safely do this.

### spyder.plugins.editor.utils.AutosaveForPlugin

This is a component of the editor plugin which implements autosaving functionality. The autosaving feature is based on a timer, which is set by the user.

### spyder.utils

Contains miscellaneous utilities like thread managers for non GUI blocking long processes, version control system assistant functions, syntax highlighting, icon managers.

### spyder.utils.create_action

A class level function that allows developers to create actions such as save, save as open, revert, and so forth. These actions are registered during the main program initialization by both the Spyder main IDE plugins and widgets.

### spyder.utils.add_actions

A class level function that is utilized by an instance of qtpy widgets; for example, this function adds created actions to a QMenu or a QToolBar.

### spyder.utils.icon_manager

A set of class level definitions which contain metadata for icon files for the aesthetics of the Spyder IDE.

### app.MainWindow

The main window which is initialized after one starts the program. Is responsible for loading all initial external modules, displaying the splash screen, populates the main window toolbars by creating and registering actions, saving the state of current sessions, restoring the state from previous sessions, etc.

### spyder.api.SpyderPluginWidget

An interface for which all plugin widgets must inherit and re-implement its interface. Basically, any class which is a plugin and a widget must inherit this interface which will enforce a specific behavior required by any plugin widget by higher level controllers. For example, console, editor, explorer, help, history are utilized by the AppearanceConfigPage class in order to apply appearance schemes to all plugin widgets. This keeps the basic required behavior and properties for all plugin widgets at the same level. In another example, upon initialization, each widget must return all of its possible menu actions, such as save, save as, and revert to the main window.

### spyder.preferences.AppearanceConfigPage

Applies appearance settings including font and color schemes to every plugin widget. This includes the editor. This class initializes all widgets using a common interface enforced method called apply_plugin_settings().

### spyder.plugins.editor.widgets.RecoveryDialog

A dialog window for recovering files from the autosave feature. This class gathers data about which files may be recovered. This data is saved within the program folder as a file of tuples, each pair of which contains data from the original saved file and the autosaved file.

### qtpy

qtpy is an abstraction layer that lets developers write applications using a single API. It provides support for PyQt5, PyQt4, and PySide using the PyQt5 layout, which is a high-level API that allows developers to interact with desktop-based features such as Bluetooth, NFC, but most importantly, traditional user interface development. Basically, you write your code as if you were using PyQt5 but import qt from qtpy instead of PyQt5.

### qtwidgets

The qtwidgets module contains classes that provide a set of user interface elements to create desktop-based user interfaces. It can be used as a container for other widgets, and it can be subclassed to create custom widgets. qtwidgets can be nested within other qtwidgets.

### qtwidgets.QToolBar

The QToolBar class provides a movable panel that contains a set of controls. Toolbar buttons are added by adding actions, using addAction or insertAction. A widget can be inserted instead of a toolbar if the button is not appropriate.

### qtwidgets.QFileDialog

The QFileDialog class provides a dialog that allows users to select files or directories. This class allows a user to navigate the file system in order to select one, many files, or a directory. With the use of static functions, we can create a QFileDialog.

### qtwidgets.QDialog

The QDialog class is the base class of dialog windows. A dialog window is a top-level window mostly used for short-term tasks and brief communications with the user. This class can provide a return value, and they can have default buttons. A dialog's default button is the button that's pressed when the user hits Enter. This button is used to signify that the user accepts the dialog's settings and wants to close the dialog.

### qtwidgets.QMenu

The QMenu class provides a menu widget for use in menu bars, context menus, and other popup menus. A menu widget is a selection menu which can be either a pull-down menu in a menu bar or a standalone context menu.

### qtwidgets.QInputDialog

The QInputDialog class provides a simple dialog to obtain individual values from a user. The input value may be strings, numbers, or items from a list. For the convenience of the users, a label may be set which maps to the value they have entered.

### qtpy.qtcompat

This class provides compatibility wrappers for critical functionality that differs across Qt versions. For example, between Qt4 and Qt5 there may have been many classes and class members that are obsolete.

### qtcompat.getopenfilenames

Under qtcompat, there are many class level functions with names which match the classes that provide compatibility functions. This class is one of these functions. The purpose is to retrieve filenames of files that are currently open and being used.

### qtcompat.getsavefilename

This is a static convenience function that will return a file name selected by the user. The file does not have to exist. It creates a modal file dialog with the given parent widget. For example, the RecoveryDialog class utilizes this method as a result of being called by the autosave plugin.

### qtpy.qtcore.QTimer

This class provides a higher level programming interface for a timer for the application which imports it. The QTimer class provides a single shot and repetitive timer functionality.
