# Spyder: Scientific Python IDE
The documentation is written on Spyder IDE for SENG 480 instructed by Dr. Neil Ernst during the Winter 2019 semester at the University of Victoria, and is written by Arman Yousef Zadeh Shooshtari, Anna Olkhovskaia, ZoÃ« Henderson, Alex Deweert, and Nitika Jindal.

The Spyder Integrated Development Environment (Spyder) is an open source cross-platform development environment for scientific programming in the Python language. Spyder integrates with a number of prominent packages in the scientific Python stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, IPython, SymPy and Cython.

Spyder is a free and open source IDE first released in 2009. Previously known as "Pydee", the project started as a port of spyderlib, which is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. Spyder offers a unique combination of advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality. It is a comprehensive development tool with data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities. Beyond its many built-in features, its abilities can be extended even further via its plugin system and API. Furthermore, Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing developers to build upon its functionality and embed its components, such as the interactive console, in their own PyQt software. [1.1]

This documentation will serve to highlight some of the key architectural features of Spyder which support some of the business drivers behind the Spyder Project. First, the documentation will highlight the key stakeholders of the project and their business goals. From these goals a list of architecturally significant requirements are derived, and then the quality attribute scenarios which detail quantitative measurements of how the architecturally significant requirements can be realized. A primary presentation of the overall architecture of Spyder, plus two interface diagrams, a context diagram, and two sequence diagrams will provide some insight into the operations of Spyder at both macro and micro levels of abstraction. Later, a component and connector diagram will provide even more detail into one of the key design decisions about how Spyder translates user GUI events into code execution and the subsequent display of rendered images. The component and connector view also provides another context diagram which summarizes the interaction between the Spyder CodeEditor and the external kernels which process code cells and update the image canvas for rendering. The documentation discusses how Spyder responds to variability in its environment, and to internal changes of architecture as well. Finally, the documentation attempts to analyze the rationale behind some of the key design decisions for the Spyder project.

## Business Goals

### Financial

Spyder is seeking an initial contribution goal of $7,000 USD in order to fund baseline development activities which include finishing Spyder 4 and hiring a part-time junior developer [1.7].

Spyder is seeking a long term sponsorship goal of $35,000 USD per year in order to match the previous funding of Anaconda and take on four part-time developers [1.7].

Spyder developers continue to seek support from the community to reach the level of funding by releasing new donation tiers and rewards in order to make the release of new features for Spyder 4 possible [1.7].

### Managing the quality and reputation of products

For the Spyder IDE project, the Spyder contributor community desires that the project continue to be starred and forked by the Github community, thereby increasing potential sponsorship and contributor numbers, directly affecting the quality of the product. In addition, the Spyder contributor community desires to provide the best Scientific Python Development Environment possible [1.8].

For the Spyder IDE project, the Spyder contributor community desires a maintained and possibly increased rate of commits, bug fixes, pace of development, and new features. This goal can be measured by comparing levels of future commits to the average based on the numbers between November 2017 through May 2018 [1.9].

## Privacy and Ethics Concerns

### Introduction

There are numerous considerations to make when conducting a privacy and ethics analysis of a software project. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) provides an excellent Code of Ethics, lending itself to guide such an analysis, and steering a software development project in the right direction. While reading over the documentation, wiki, and the project website for the Spyder Python IDE (Spyder), it was discovered that a specific policy or code of ethics of their own was not present. It was left to the authors of this document to make conclusions based on a combination of references to the ACM and the existing documentation and code for Spyder. However, there are many boilerplate [1.2] licenses within the Spyder Github repository. This indicates that the developer group is concerned, at least in part, with legal use and distribution of their software. In addition, extensive copyright agreements exist within the repository within 3rd party libraries and frameworks, as well as Spyder proprietary software.

### Potential Privacy and Security Concerns

Within the Spyder Github code, there is a partially boilerplate MIT style license which permits commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use of their product. Moreover, this license absolves Spyder Project Contributors, at least in part, of any liability under the categories claim, damages, or âother.â This is not, of course, a direct indication that the Spyder Project Contributors themselves are purposely making their software available for malicious or negligent use. However, we still must consider that the developers of the project do not hold themselves liable for any use of the product. Such a consideration is relevant given that Spyder could possibly be used for either a safety or infrastructure related purpose. Of course, these are only speculative considerations for the purposes of this assignment.

Given the open source nature of this project, we must consider that any software utilized on the internet carries with it an inherent danger surrounding privacy issues. Consider one simple example where Notepad++ was âhijackedâ by a United States government agency to have access to the content of files written on Notepad++ [1.11]. Since this project is open source, then itâs mechanics are even more subject to potential analysis and subsequent exploitation by outside parties. Another such example occurred during malicious use of the Dolphin video game emulator [1.5, 1.6], allowing arbitrary code execution through disc images; it is clear that open source code is not always just viewed or referenced, but used to design nefarious exploits.

### Ethical Dilemmas

It is not immediately obvious that Spyder Project Contributors are subject to any kind of explicit agreement to guide project contributions. There is an open invitation to anybody who wants to contribute the project, but neither contribution nor ethical guidelines could not be located [1.1]. Granted, any code that is submitted is done so via pull request, so the primary contributors and administrators of the Spyder code base presumably will check for malicious or poorly written code. The dilemma here is that anybody who makes a contribution to the Spyder code base is under no apparent set of guiding principles, or, under the kind of scrutiny that somebody in a private sector development job might be under. In addition, an open source contributor has lower stakes on which to base their reputation and livelihood on considering that contributions are done anonymously absent a threat of being fired or ostracised.

An ethical dilemma could arise if a 3rd party company makes significant monetary gains following use of the Spyder product either through direct use of the product, or by a redistribution and possible rebranding. Considering that there exists an extensive use and licensing document present on the Spyder project Github site [1.2], these rules appear to be for both end users of Spyder, and for developers of Spyder who contribute to the project. Clearly, failure to abide by these rules could result in some legal action based on an oversight of ethical software development and/or business practices.

One particular point in the ACM mentions fair treatment of groups or individuals regardless of their race, community, gender, or general orientation. Any large-scale open source project is certainly subject to public scrutiny with regards to ethical consideration surrounding such unfair treatment. A negative outcry or investigation based on such conflicts of interest might affect the business goals of Spyder [1.4].

## Summary

Regarding the ACM General Ethical Principles (in particular to avoid harm, to be fair, taking action not to discriminate, respecting privacy, respecting the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts), initial perusal of the documentation and issues forums seems to indicate that Spyder IDE community adheres to these principles [1.3,1.10].

Regarding section 3.7 of the ACM (to recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society), considering that applications written in Spyder utilize the underlying architecture and design decisions of the Spyder IDE global contributors, we believe that the overall quality of code of the project must be strongly considered in order to determine whether this guideline is adhered to or not. This may or may not be ascertained following more extensive documentation of this project later on in the course. At this early stage, however, an in depth product quality analysis based on understanding Spyder architecture is not immediately obvious, and may be weighed in upon at another time.

# Architecturally Significant Requirements

1. Upon closing the Spyder IDE, the userâs work must be saved at least once. In the event of a system or software crash, saved versions of the most recently changed documents can be restored from an automatic backup, so the Spyder IDE must backup unsaved files at regular intervals.
2. The Spyder IDE should be able to show syntactic errors in a way that the programmer can easily understand the cause of the error.
3. Spyder must be able to run on different operating systems.
4. Spyder must be able to support most recent versions of Python.
5. Spyder should be able to run on a wide variety of hardware.
6. Updates to the Spyder IDE should allow previous Spyder project compatibility assuming that the project is reasonably recent.
7. Spyder must capture and handle user program or Spyder tool failures by generating comprehensive bug, error, and exception reports
8. Spyder must draw graphs, diagrams, and execute code with low latency.
9. A user must be able to easily debug and trace their code in the Spyder IDE using debugging, tracing, and breakpoint tools.
10. A code-completion aid feature similar to Microsoft IntelliSense should available as a tool in Spyder IDE.

## Quality Attribute Scenarios

| Quality Attributes | Attribute Refinement | Scenarios |
|------|--------|--------|
| Performance | Runtime Latency | A user wishes to graph a three-dimensional dataset at the Large Hadron Collider based on particle acceleration and collision. Since these datasets are notoriously very large, the user is skeptical that the graph will render quickly, but is happy to discover that data processing and rendering is relatively fast (H M).|
| Security | Data Integrity | A user works on a large piece of code for an hour having saved once at the beginning, the power goes out and the user attempts to recover lost work. The user finds that 98% of their code is still available due to the automatic backup system (H L). |
| Usability | Syntax error comprehension | A user writes code that has > 50 syntax errors, the errors are shown to the user by caution symbol on the affected lines so they can easily identify their errors (H M). |
| | Runtime error comprehension | A new user unfamiliar with python is experimenting with their code, upon running it the IDE comprehensive informs them of the errors in such a way that they can easily trace their errors (H M).|
| | Debugging and Tracing | A developer is creating a complex program that has a difficult runtime error. The user is unable to find the error by simply tracing the code, so the user adds a breakpoint so that execution is halted, and the variable states can be examined. The user easily determines how the values of the variables are changing in the flow of the code which causes the runtime error (H M). |
| | Template Based Completion | A developer is writing many classes with similarly structure code, each of which will require customized tweaks based on a boilerplate style of initial design, but cannot be compressed into a single class. To save time, the user presses a combination of keys to activate the code-completion feature and is able to select from a saved list of code template (H H). |
| Accessibility | Syntax Colouring | A user is colorblind. Spyder supports changing syntax highlighting to a user-defined color palette (M L). |
| | Key Mapping | A user has motor control issues. Spyder supports remapping keyboard shortcuts, which can act as an aid for some people (M L). |
| Maintainability | Modularity | A developer wants to add features; Spyder's loose coupling allows them modify, add, and swap components without headache (M H). |

## Primary Presentation

This view implements the "uses" style of module views. Here we present the overall architecture of the Spyder IDE with a focus on three specific aspects of the architecture which highlight its plugin widget system for extensibility, and two quality attribute scenarios from Milestone 2.

And the scenarios are:

1. A developer is writing many classes with similarly structure code, each of which will require customized tweaks based on a boilerplate style of initial design, but cannot be compressed into a single class. To save time, the user presses a combination of keys to activate the code-completion feature and is able to select from a saved list of code template. (Intellisense).
2. A user works on a large piece of code for an hour having saved once at the beginning, the power goes out and the user attempts to recover his/her lost work. The user finds that 98% of their code is still available due to the automatic backup system.

## Element Catalogue

### spyder

Spyder is the main outer package which contains all the business logic for the Spyder IDE project. Almost all of the important logic with respect to the functionality of the entire IDE is contained in this package. It is an all-encompassing package at the root level of the project which includes version control, scripting, and continuous integration packages as well. It provides functionality such as opening, editing, and saving files which contain code or text.

### spyder.plugins

The plugins package contains the code for plugin modules which are appended to the primary spyder base code. Spyder works on the basis of adding plugins for additional IDE functionality, which is good design since it keeps the code modular and extensible. These plugins include such modules as editor, console, breakpoints, explorer, etc. For example, the editor is the window where one would write code. The console would be a docked or floating window where one would see program output from the stdout or stderr output streams.

### spyder.plugins.editor

This is a package which contains the editor plugin. The editor is the main window within which a developer would edit code. The package also contains the code for the editor API itself, which would allow outside modules to communicate with an editor object or to call editor functions.

### spyder.plugins.editor.Editor

This is a class within the plugin.py file that contains most of the base logic for an editor widget. This class also contains the functions that handle file autosaving for both individual editors and stacks of editors.

### spyder.plugins.editor.utils

This is a package which contains the code for utilities for the editor plugin. For example, autosave, debugging, folding, etc. This package also contains testing for these utilities as well as the code for initialization.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp

This package contains all of the code that handles the spyder Language Server Protocol client implementations. This also includes the ZMQ/TCP proxy classes (under the transport package) which act as an intermediary between the Spyder LSPClient and the LanguageServerClient.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.LSPClient

This class acts as a client for communication with the LanguageServerClient via ZMQ and implements the calls and procedures required to communicate with a v3.0 Language Server Protocol server (via ZMQ).

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.LSPManager

This class manages all LSPClients connected to language servers defined in the preferences of the Spyder project.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.transport

This package contains the implementation code for the ZMQ/TCP proxy classes which are run independently from the main Spyder program.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.transport.main

This module isnât a class, rather it acts as an entry point for the ZMQ/Proxy system, initializing a LanguageServerClient and, by extension the requisite ZMQ incoming and outgoing ports for communication with LSPClients.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.transport.LanguageServerClient

This class handles incoming requests from the actual Spyder LSP client ZMQ queue, encapsulates them into valid JSONRPC messages and sends them to an LSP server via TCP.

### spyder.plugins.editor.lsp.transport.IncomingMessageThread

This class handles and processes incoming TCP messages sent by a Language Server Protocol server, then it relays the information to the actual Spyder LSP client via ZMQ.

### zmq

ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications. Spyder uses ZMQ for communication with a ZMQ/TCP proxy system which relays requests to a Language Server (via TCP) in order to facilitate Intellisense like functionality such as code completion, code insights, and definitions.

### zmq.Context

Contexts help manage any sockets that are created as well as the number of threads ZeroMQ uses behind the scenes. ZMQ handles the creation and destruction of sockets when processes are started and terminated. Contexts can be shared between threads and, in fact, are the only ZeroMQ objects that can safely do this.

### spyder.plugins.editor.utils.AutosaveForPlugin

This is a component of the editor plugin which implements autosaving functionality. The autosaving feature is based on a timer, which is set by the user.

### spyder.utils

Contains miscellaneous utilities like thread managers for non GUI blocking long processes, version control system assistant functions, syntax highlighting, icon managers.

### spyder.utils.create_action

A class level function that allows developers to create actions such as save, save as open, revert, and so forth. These actions are registered during the main program initialization by both the Spyder main IDE plugins and widgets.

### spyder.utils.add_actions

A class level function that is utilized by an instance of qtpy widgets; for example, this function adds created actions to a QMenu or a QToolBar.

### spyder.utils.icon_manager

A set of class level definitions which contain metadata for icon files for the aesthetics of the Spyder IDE.

### app.MainWindow

The main window which is initialized after one starts the program. Is responsible for loading all initial external modules, displaying the splash screen, populates the main window toolbars by creating and registering actions, saving the state of current sessions, restoring the state from previous sessions, etc.

### spyder.api.SpyderPluginWidget

An interface for which all plugin widgets must inherit and re-implement its interface. Basically, any class which is a plugin and a widget must inherit this interface which will enforce a specific behavior required by any plugin widget by higher level controllers. For example, console, editor, explorer, help, history are utilized by the AppearanceConfigPage class in order to apply appearance schemes to all plugin widgets. This keeps the basic required behavior and properties for all plugin widgets at the same level. In another example, upon initialization, each widget must return all of its possible menu actions, such as save, save as, and revert to the main window.

### spyder.preferences.AppearanceConfigPage

Applies appearance settings including font and color schemes to every plugin widget. This includes the editor. This class initializes all widgets using a common interface enforced method called apply_plugin_settings().

### spyder.plugins.editor.widgets.RecoveryDialog

A dialog window for recovering files from the autosave feature. This class gathers data about which files may be recovered. This data is saved within the program folder as a file of tuples, each pair of which contains data from the original saved file and the autosaved file.

### qtpy

qtpy is an abstraction layer that lets developers write applications using a single API. It provides support for PyQt5, PyQt4, and PySide using the PyQt5 layout, which is a high-level API that allows developers to interact with desktop-based features such as Bluetooth, NFC, but most importantly, traditional user interface development. Basically, you write your code as if you were using PyQt5 but import qt from qtpy instead of PyQt5.

### qtwidgets

The qtwidgets module contains classes that provide a set of user interface elements to create desktop-based user interfaces. It can be used as a container for other widgets, and it can be subclassed to create custom widgets. qtwidgets can be nested within other qtwidgets.

### qtwidgets.QToolBar

The QToolBar class provides a movable panel that contains a set of controls. Toolbar buttons are added by adding actions, using addAction or insertAction. A widget can be inserted instead of a toolbar if the button is not appropriate.

### qtwidgets.QFileDialog

The QFileDialog class provides a dialog that allows users to select files or directories. This class allows a user to navigate the file system in order to select one, many files, or a directory. With the use of static functions, we can create a QFileDialog.

### qtwidgets.QDialog

The QDialog class is the base class of dialog windows. A dialog window is a top-level window mostly used for short-term tasks and brief communications with the user. This class can provide a return value, and they can have default buttons. A dialog's default button is the button that's pressed when the user hits Enter. This button is used to signify that the user accepts the dialog's settings and wants to close the dialog.

### qtwidgets.QMenu

The QMenu class provides a menu widget for use in menu bars, context menus, and other popup menus. A menu widget is a selection menu which can be either a pull-down menu in a menu bar or a standalone context menu.

### qtwidgets.QInputDialog

The QInputDialog class provides a simple dialog to obtain individual values from a user. The input value may be strings, numbers, or items from a list. For the convenience of the users, a label may be set which maps to the value they have entered.

### qtpy.qtcompat

This class provides compatibility wrappers for critical functionality that differs across Qt versions. For example, between Qt4 and Qt5 there may have been many classes and class members that are obsolete.

### qtcompat.getopenfilenames

Under qtcompat, there are many class level functions with names which match the classes that provide compatibility functions. This class is one of these functions. The purpose is to retrieve filenames of files that are currently open and being used.

### qtcompat.getsavefilename

This is a static convenience function that will return a file name selected by the user. The file does not have to exist. It creates a modal file dialog with the given parent widget. For example, the RecoveryDialog class utilizes this method as a result of being called by the autosave plugin.

### qtpy.qtcore.QTimer

This class provides a higher level programming interface for a timer for the application which imports it. The QTimer class provides a single shot and repetitive timer functionality.

## Element Interface

![Interface 1]https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/interface1.png?raw=true

An interface is a boundary across which two independent entities meet and interact or communicate with each other.

### Interface Identity 

This means giving a meaningful name to the interface in a context that explains exactly what the interface does. This interface is called the "ZMQ/TCP Proxy Module". It is a small collection of two classes working together under one controller, acting independently of the Spyder main code.

### Resources Provided

A set of resources that the element provides to its actors

### Resource Syntax

1. msg = {'id': self.request_seq, 'method': method,'params': params}
2. zmq_out_socket.send_pyobj(msg)

### Resource Semantics 

1. msg creates a Python JSON formatted data structure containing the method request name, the Id parameter is is a numeric value to keep track of the total language server requests, and the params parameter which is an additional JSON python object populated with different parameters depending on an external element that makes use of the interface.
2. The zmq_out_socket is a ZMQ socket object which has bound to it as send_pyobj function. That function takes the msg parameter and serializes it using pickle. The interface requires this resource to be serialized since it is a JSON data structure, that it will later convert and re-send via TCP.

### Resource Usage Restrictions

This section defines the circumstances under which the resource may be used. The resources provided to the ZMQ/TCP Proxy Module must include all parameters including Id, Method, and the nested params object. In addition, this resource cannot be used until it broadcasts a SERVER READY signal, indicating that a language request can be made.

### Locally defined data types

There are no data types not natively supported by Python that are required to use this resource. Python natively supports JSON style objects. The resource itself converts these datatypes to serialized Python objects using Python Pickle.

### Error Handling

Errors are handled by Python try-except. ZMQ sockets handle errors by converting error messages with zmq_sterror() to meaningly error strings passed into the current environment.

### Variability provided

This section highlights how the interface may allow the element to be configured in some way. zmq_setsockopt() allows configurations to be viewed and set. They act in a similar way to settings typical TCP sockets.

### Quality attribute characteristics

The architect needs to document what quality attribute characteristics the interface makes known to the elementâs users. Here we have the QAS under usability being made visible to the element's users, which use it indirectly. The element provides indirect access to code completion functionality.

### What the element requires

In this section, we highlight what the element requires that may be specific, named resources provided by other elements. External language server must be initialized, and it required that the parameters specified in the above sections be passed in exactly as noted. The element itself requires a developer to specify its network and port addresses for TCP, as well as the ZMQ in and out ports. In terms of data input to the element, the element can act asynchronously so it can be accessed simultaneously by multiple external elements. 

### Rationale and design issues

For this section, the rationale should explain the motivation behind the design. The decision to utilize this style to create the ZMQ/TCP Proxy Module was to take advantage of the caching style necessary to facilitate voluminous amounts of data coming in from many potential sources (other elements within Spyder who want to make language requests). The ZMQ portion of the element provides a queue of requests so that the TCP portion can handle as fast as it can. Since ZMQ requests are so much faster than TCP, a queue within this element is necessary to cache buffered language requests as necessary.

### Usage guide 

The language server should already be initialized, it is an external resource.
 Here we initialize the ZMQ/TCP Proxy Module (can be from main)
 
 ~~~~ client = LanguageServerClient(host=args.server_host,

### Element Interface

![Interface 2](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/interface2.png?raw=true)

An interface is a boundary across which two independent entities meet and interact or communicate with each other.

### Interface Identity 

EditorStack is the module which facilitates communication between Spyder and the host machine. Specifically, writing to a file and receiving a success or error code.

### Resources Provided

A python object which contains data to be written to a file, or a code which indicates success or failure to Spyder.

### Resource Syntax

self._write_to_file(finfo, finfo.filename)

### Resource Semantics

1. finfo contains the actual information which is to be written to the filesystem. Filename contains the metadata that will be contained in the file written out.
2. The response code from the operating system from which the file is written will be interpreted by Python as a success or failure depending on the code received, and an exception will be thrown as appropriate.

### Resource Usage Restrictions

This section defines the circumstances under which the resource may be used. From the client portion (Spyder) there must exist changes to a file that can be written to the file system. For the second client to use the resource it simply has to be running (Spyder) and it has to have been preceded by a file write request in order to make a request to the Spyder program.

### Locally defined data types

Spyder fileinfo (which contains python objects and metadata) is the only locally defined datatype required for this interface.

### Error handling

Errors are handled by Python try-except. Attempting to write to a file that cannot be opened by the second client (the host machine) will result in the return of the requisite error code which will trigger an exception in Python, handled as an EnvironmentError.

### Variability provided

This section highlights how the interface may allow the element to be configured in some way. There is no specific variability to the file to be written out except for the contents in the python byte object, and the filename which will be created or written to by the host machine.

### Quality attribute characteristics

The architect needs to document what quality attribute characteristics the interface makes known to the elementâs users. Autosaving was deemed to be an important feature for the Spyder IDE. Aside from the _write_to_file function, there is nothing else made apparent to the elements users.

### What the element requires

This element requires data from the file to be written to, which include changes byte data that reflects changes made to the file in the Editor stack, a file name (and other metadata) and it needs a response code from the host machine.

### Rationale and design issues

The design of this interface seems to be a standard design pattern for writing to and receiving responses from host machines as necessary. There aren't many design issues to consider other than how the interface handles errors from both clients ends. For example, if an illegal filename is provided, or how to handle not enough memory errors (on disk). The Spyder interface, EditorStack, surrounds its actions with try except and shows a dialog to the end user should an error occur, indicating what the problem was. or the host machine (the secondary client) there are no design issues to consider aside from how the interface is designed to write data, which is controlled via system API dependent on the host machine.

### Usage guide

~~~~ try:
            self._write_to_file(finfo, finfo.filename)
            ...
        except EnvironmentError as error:
            self.msgbox = QMessageBox(
                    QMessageBox.Critical,
                    _("Save Error"),
                    _("<b>Unable to save file '%s'</b>"
                      "<br><br>Error message:<br>%s"
                      ) % (osp.basename(finfo.filename),
                                        str(error)),
                    parent=self)

### Context Diagram

This view shows how the Spyder IDE interacts with its external environment. Note the external libraries that are optional, but could be imported by a Spyder user to add plotting functionality. In addition, Spyder utilizes both ascii based file input and output, as well as the popular HDF5 file format more suited to large numerical datasets. We also show the interaction with Spyder and it's end users, as well as Jupyter console input and output. Finally, this view highlights how Spyder meets one of the QAS where a user has access to Code Completion behavior in the Spyder editor window, and how this feature is facilitated by an external highspeed ZMQ messaging system as a proxy to an external Language Server via TCP.

![Context Diagram](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/context_diagram.png?raw=true) 

### Sequence Diagram for QAS1 

The following diagram outlines how the Spyder IDE achieves the requirements in the QAS for the IDE autosaving system:

A user works on a large piece of code for an hour having saved once at the beginning, the power goes out and the user attempts to recover lost work. The user finds that 98% of their code is still available due to the automatic backup system (H L).

![Autosave Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/autosave_sequence_diagram.png?raw=true)

### Details of Interaction (Autosave Sequence Diagram) 

The manual and autosave functionality is detailed in the above sequence diagram. This diagram shows how the interactions that take place between a user, the core Spyder code (specifically the Editor), and some of the external libraries which provide GUI functionality, culminate in the eventual saving of a file; a user opens Spyder which subsequently initalizes a CodeEditor, and it's EditorStack (which is a stack of Editor widgets that represent one file each). A user must first manually save a file before it is autosaved. A user clicks one of the GUI options for saving, the Editor retrieves the stack of Editor widgets, locates the current editor (the one that the user has active), and calls the save function. The editor stack then calls it's "_write_to_file" function. This is where the actual file saving occurs. But it also triggers a number of other functions that tell the autosave timer to actually start. The autosave timer calls the exact same function, write_to_file.

### Sequence Diagram for QAS2

The following diagram outlines how the Spyder IDE achieves the requirements in the QAS for the IDE CodeCompletion system:

A developer is writing many classes with similarly structured code, each of which will require customized tweaks based on a boilerplate style of initial design but cannot be compressed into a single class. To save time, the user presses a combination of keys to activate the code-completion feature and is able to select from a saved list of code templates (H H).

![Code Completion Sequence](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/code_completion_sequence_diagram.png?raw=true)

### Details of Interaction (Code Completion Sequence Diagram)

This diagram highlights the sequence actions that takes place within the Spyder code base when a user opens the program, types something into a code editor, and the subsequent functional behavior that occurs and causes a code completion, syntax highlighting, or symbol definition event to take place. 

When the user starts the Spyder program, the MainWindow module initializes an Editor module, which initializes a CodeEditor object as well. The CodeEditor object represents the actual window that a user types characters into. Once the CodeEditor is started, it initializes an LSPClient, which forms part of the communication triad between itself, the ZMQ messaging library, adn the LanguageServerClient. The LanguageServerClient's initalization is also shown (top right of the diagram) which, chronologically, is initalized prior to the CodeEditor. When the LanguageServerClient is started, it starts listening and forwarding threads and sockets for data to and from both the LSPClient (on the Spyder side) and an external language server that utilizes the Microsoft Language Server Protocol.Rationale

### Rationale

The Spyder Integrated Development Environment (Spyder) appears to have been designed with extensibility in mind. Every feature available to a developer in Spyder is implemented as a plugin. These plugins are divided in such a way that there is a clear distinction between the responsibility of each feature. There is a central module which handles initialization of all primary plugins. Any plugin that is to be made part of Spyder must implement a plugin interface so that any such plugin can be easily integrated by the central module. The benefit of dividing these plugins by functionality, but forcing them to implement an interface, is that developers do not need to concern themselves with the constraint that alteration of one plugin, or the central code, will negatively affect the behaviour of the system, so long as the set of inputs and outputs (based on the standards established by interface functions) is adhered to.

Spyder also utilizes client-server architecture in order to provide services common to many development environments. Specifically, the ability to recognize syntax, code insights, and look up definitions. The client-server architecture is a software design pattern in which the server hosts, supplies, and manages most of a client's resources and services. The client-server architecture was used here specifically to maintain both modularity, in the sense that the Language Server Protocol features and functionality remain outside of the primary code base, and usability, in the form of speed due to the concurrency of an asynchronous messaging library and queue-based interface system. The modular approach allows external language clients to be switched out, as well as the interface (the ZMQ/TCP Proxy module) between the Spyder client and the language server itself.

For one of our quality attribute scenarios, we highlighted the use of the ZMQ which is a high performance messaging library and Language Server Protocol (LSP) which allows the Microsoft Intellisense feature to be present in the Spyder IDE. The Spyder IDE acts as a client and communicates with an LSP server through a ZMQ/TCP proxy system. The ZMQ/TCP proxy system code is contained within the Spyder IDE codebase, but it is executed independently from the main Spyder IDE MainWindow and CodeEditor. Here we have a client-server style of communication taking place between two or more modules, but acting independently with minimal coupling due to the highly modular plugin system.

Spyder is a perfect example of the benefits of modular software design. If, at some point in the future, the Spyder Development community decides to alter the code editor so that it uses a faster communication protocol, either in its ZMQ/TCP proxy, or in its LSPClient, minimal changes are required in either the central code, or any other plugins that make use of the Language Server as well. This, of course, is not limited to just the CodeEditor and the Language Server. The debugger, help system, console, linting system, and many others are all implemented using the plugin system, all of which implement the plugin interface.

# Component and Connector View

## Primary Presentation 

![Primary Presentation M4](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/PrimaryPresentationM4.png?raw=true)

## Element Catalogue

### Spyder Code Edito

The Spyder CodeEditor is a child to the parent module, Editor, which is more of a manager class for EditorStack objects (similar to an editor tab in your favorite IDE) which themselves contain CodeEditor objects. However, the CodeEditor's themselves utilize FigureBrowser class in order to display the results of code cells executed from within either the CodeEditor or an attached ShellWidget.

### plugins.editor.Editor

The plugins.editor.Editor registers the signal at the start of the event causing a chain reaction. The editor registers sig_run_cell as well as the _run_cell_in_ipyclient signals making a connection with them.

### plugins.plots.Plots

This class binds the ShellWidget to the figurebrowser class, because of this, whenever the ShellWidget notifies the figurebrowser about the data change, the figurebrowser class automatically display that change.

### Run Cell (GUI event)

"Run Cell" is the GUI event which gets called whenever the user clicks on the run cell button which is present in the UI, presses the F5 key, or clicks the context menu item "Run Cell" in order to execute the written code. The result of this event is that a signal object emits (publishes) an event to its connected functions, triggering a chain of events eventually culminating in the render and display of a graph from the internal/external kernel should an image result from that execution.

### sig_run_cell

This is a QTCore Signal object which is initialized during registration of a CodeEditor object which is initialized by an EditorStack parent class, which in turn is managed and initialized by a parent Editor object. The Editor object, during initial program startup, causes the sig_run_cell signal object to become connected to functions which trigger a series of other signals (emits/publishing actions) to eventually execute a code cell.

### QTCore emit

Emit is a function of the QTCore package which broadcasts a signal to any functions connected to it. The connected functions listen (subscribe) to incoming signals and become activated when a signal emit is heard.

### QTCore Signal

QtCore.Signal() is a resource provided by the QTCore signaling interface which facilitates asynchronous communication between thinly connected signals and functions. Such functions may be anonymous, and many such functions can be connected to one signal object. For example, one such signal handler is a QTcore signal object which is connected to the Signal emit function \_run_cell_text. Every signal may be attached to a connected function run_cell_copde, and there can be multiple connected functions acting as multiple listeners. This particular one is calling a function run cell.

### \_run_cell_text

The \_run_cell_text function in the editor is connected to sig_run_cell signal within the editor stack. This function is a chain of function calls formatting the code into an executable format.

### plugins.editor.widgets.EditorStack

\_run_cell_in_ipyclient is the function in run cell text which is in the Editor stack. It calls the \_run_cell_in_ipyclient which created a chain of events creating the signal. It's an editor window and editor stack has a code window. Editor stacks have code editors. Each editor stack contains a code editor. Each code editor stack has a code editor which has a code which is known as the cell. The Cell can run, either the full code or just a part of it.

![Editor Stack](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/EditorStack.PNG?raw=true)

### run_cell_in_ipyclient

Editor stack calls the function run_cell_in_ipyclient, it emits another signal which is the run_cell function in IPythonClient. This function is another step in the chain of commands triggered by the original GUI run cell broadcast.

### run_cell_in_ipyclient

This is a signal emitted by the Editor stack. Run_cell_in_ipyclient is another QTcore signal. This has a connected function and an emit function, the emit function is a qtcore function which is attached to the qtcore signal object.

This is a QTCore signal which is emitted by the editor stack and run_cell_in_ipyclient function. It has a connected function and an emit function, the emit function is a QTCore function which is attached to the qtcore signal object.

### plugins.plots.widgets.IPythonClient

IPythonClient stands for interactive python client and is also an instantiated member of each shell widget. The IPythonClient class forms a point of communication with either internal or external kernels which execute formatted code taken from either the code editor or the shell widget code cells.

### run_cell

A function of the IPythonClient. Another step in passing executable code down from the initial emitted broadcast due to a GUI event that in turn will trigger the silent_execute function within IPythonClient as well.

### silent_execute

The result of calling IPythonClient's run_cell command also results in this function being called, taking executable code from the source of a GUI event in which a user triggers "run cel", and finally forwarding that code to either an internal or external kernel which will evaluate the code and return a result.

### plugins.plots.widgets.ShellWidget

The shell widget can be observed in the following diagram (figure 3) as a tab labeled (for example) as "Console 1/A", "Console 2/A" etc. This is essentially a console instance embedded within a code editor. The ShellWidget contains an instantiation of an IPythonConsole which acts as a client for communication with an internal or external kernel. For the purposes of the Component and Connector view, the ShellWidget in this use case is one of the last few endpoints of execution as a result of a Signal emit broadcast that was triggered by a user clicking a GUI option essentially attempting to run a code cell.

The executable code passed down from the events prior to this will be sent to CodeWidget and which will send the executable code to the external kernel for processing and interpretation. The image below is a slightly outdated version of Spyder taken from the project website. The image shown is actually the FeatureBrowser element, now partially separated out from the ShellWidget itself.

![Shell Widget](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/ShellWidget.PNG?raw=true)

### External Kernal

This encompasses any qualifying external modules with a kernel such as Matplotlib, Pandas or SciPy. The kernel must notify the Shellwidget and figure browser of the results of any code execution.

### Notify Data Change

A generalized label provided to any event which is emitted as a result of execution from an external kernel.

For the purpose of this view, the data change is an event caused by the external kernel causing a notification to be made available to ShellWidget, FigureBrowser, or any other listening widgets.

### figurebrowser handle_new_figure

The Notify data change which we got from the ShellWidget class will be passed to this signal handler Which will emit a UI event to the spyder CodeEditor. Figure browser is the class which, and handle_new_figure is the function that deals with changes broadcasted by the internal/external kernel.

### UI Event

Any event which triggers the user interface of Spyder to become changed in some way. In this particular case, the UI event is caused first by a user clicking Run Cell, culminating in a series of broadcasts and functions calls, leading to the rendering of an image on the FigureBrowser

### Element Interface

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/m4_interface.png?raw=true)

An interface is a boundary across which two independent entities meet and interact or communicate with each other.

## QT Signals and Slots Interface

### Interface Identity

QtCore.SIGNAL() and QtCore.SLOT() macros allow Python to interface with Qt signal and slot delivery mechanisms.

### Resources Provided

1. Signal(void) or Signal(object)
2. Connect(function)
3. Emit(void) or Emit(object)
4. Slot(void) or Slot(params)

### Resource Syntax

         # This signal is only used on tests.
         # It could be used to track and profile LSP diagnostics.
         self.lsp_response_signal.emit(method, params)
~~~~

### Resource Semantics

Signal is an interface that is provided by the QTCore library utilized by Spyder. It provides Emit which is a broadcast to any classes which have connected functions. These classes listen for emits which cause functions to be executed.

Emit is simply a broadcast function that causes connection functions to fire.

Slot is an annotation that can be provided to functions that allow emits to fire with/without connecting them first.

Connecting is a way to call functions using emit signals without using the Slot annotation.

### Resource Usage Restrictions

The signals and slots interface provides an intermediate set of functions which facilitate publishers and subscribers within Spyder. 1. Signal is a constructor for a Signals and Slots Interface object. 2. Connect takes a callback function that will run only when a publisher received an emitted signal from a subscriber. 3. Emit allows a publisher to broadcast a signal to any connected or slotted class functions within Python. 4. Slot provides an ability to annotate multiple functions which, when connected to a Signal object, may optionally receive emissions that contain Python data objects.

### Error Handling

Any of the functions provided by the interface cannot be used within the try and catch statements. Doing so will cause an error itself. For errors to be handled, QTApplication must be subclassed and the code tried and caught there. Exceptions are not thrown in the typical sense by QT. Instead, error codes are used. Error codes will propagate if there is not a connected function (or set of connected functions) if the connected function itself causes erroneous behavior or slot code does not exist.

### Locally Defined Data Types

There are no explicitly defined local datatypes made in order to utilize this interface. A python data object is can be any data type which can be emitted and received by a publisher/subscriber pair. These include serialized first-class functions (functions that can be treated like objects, including anonymous functions), primitive data types, and data structures like arrays and dictionaries.

### Variability Provided

It would be possible to implement one's own version of a publisher and subscriber system. This may or may not be faster than the current solution which is asynchronous and apparently robust. In terms of whether or not a publisher-subscriber system might be replaced with another design pattern, it seems that the model view controller could possibly be used for this specific example. In addition, it might be less subject to the confusing code, resulting in a more maintainable project. Publisher and subscriber can result in sometimes hard to trace listens and broadcasts.

### Quality Attribute Characteristics

This interface lends itself to the quality attribute where the user executes code and can see their graph quite quickly. Signals and emissions facilitate asynchronous communication between classes with connected functions, and thus, communication between the Spyder figure browser, and any code that is executed by an internal or external kernel.

### What the element requires

The element requires functions and defined signals. These functions can be both pre-defined or anonymous.

### Rationale and design issues

As mentioned in variability, it is possible that the use of signals and connected functions for the publisher and subscriber model could lead to difficult to trace or debug code. Since one emit can potentially trigger one or more function calls, it may be hard to trace behavior should a bug arise.

### Usage Guide

A user wishes to facilitate communication between the two classes. One or more functions are defined in class A. In class B, a signal object is created and connected to the functions previously defined in class A. In future, the signal object is "emitted" which then calls any connected functions.

## Spyder Plugin Widget Interface

### Interface Identity 

A Spyder Plugin Widget Interface allows a user to input value or performs a function. Widgets enhance user interaction with the IPython notebook.

### Resources Provided

1. get_plugin_title(): Return plugin title.
2. get_plugin_icon(): Return plugin icon (QIcon instance).
3. get_focus_widget(): Return the widget to give focus to. This is applied when plugin's dockwidget is raised on top-level.
4. closing_plugin(): Perform actions before the parent main window is closed. Return True or False whether the plugin may be closed immediately or not.
5. refresh_plugin(): Refreshes the widget
6. get_plugin_actions(): Return a list of QAction's related to plugin. Note: These actions will be shown in the plugins Options menu.
7. on_first_registration(): Action to be performed on first plugin registration.
8. register_plugin(): Register plugin in Spyder's main window.
9. update_font(): This must be reimplemented by plugins that need to adjust their fonts.
10. apply_plugin_settings(): What to do to apply configuration plugin settings.

~~~~

### Resource Semantics

The resources provided by the SpyderPluginWidget interface are quite self-explanatory. Each of the required functions allows the Spyder mainwindow to initialize each plugin, and apply settings as necessary to all widgets in a similar way. In the case of the CodeEditor which contains the ShellWidget, FigureBrowser, and IPythonClient widgets, a universal interface is necessary to keep all of the instances of these objects accessible and variable in the same way. That is, changes to the Spyder IDE must be reflected in all attached modules.

### Resource Usage Restrictions

The only restriction is that this resource must be implemented by any plugin module to be implemented within Spyder.
Locally defined data types
There are no locally defined custom datatypes to mention in order to utilize this resource.

### Error handling

The error handling required when utilizing this resource is just typical Python try excepts. The actual error handling will differ from plugin to plugin.

### Variability provided

There isn't a lot of room for variability when utilizing this interface. Changing the enforced function declarations would require a developer to change every other plugin that implements the SpyderPlyginWidget interface as well. This is prohibitive due to the time required unless the interface change is quite trivial. From the extensibility and modularity perspective, this interface allows variability in other ways. However, from a core architecture standpoint, the interface explicitly prohibits variation outside of what is required.

### Quality attribute characteristics

This interface is directly related to many quality attribute characteristics mentioned in this project, but specifically, it facilitates the integration of a code browser, together with a console widget with internal or external kernels to execute code cells, and an image browser to view the results of such code execution should a kernel produce an image.

### What the element requires

The element simply requires a plugin to be implemented in the correct way, "using" the interface means implementing its enforced functions. From the perspective of both elements which use the interface, one must implement, and one must utilize. So the interface element simply requires co-operation.

### Rationale and design issues

As mentioned in variability, the interface is restrictive in one way, but also provides extensibility in another. This style of design certainly lends itself to easy contribution from many sources and coding styles; perfect for an open source community driven project.

## Context Diagram
Here we see a very simple context diagram which highlights how the Spyder CodeEditor communicates with outside modules in order to interpret a user action in the GUI, resulting in a signal broadcast firing off a chain of events, eventually resulting in an image rendered to the FigureBrowser attached to the CodeEditor window.

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/m4_context_diagram.png?raw=true)

## Variability Guide

The publisher and subscriber model is one that could easily be replaced with a variation to achieve the same rendering result at a similar rate. In addition, it might be better-structured code as well. As previously noted, the signals and listeners style of architecture, in this case, is quite prone to unreadable code and difficult to trace bugs and errors. In terms of performance, as long as the signals connected functions are structured well, and they themselves do not cause blocking behavior, then the overall behavior of Spyder will be quite fast at rendering images as a result of code execution, given the asynchronous nature of the QTCore signal library.

The rendering speed of images also heavily relies upon the kernel within which the code cell is interpreted/executed. Here we have quite a lot of flexibility in terms of what kinds of code might be run by Spyder, and at what speed. This, of course, is facilitated by the SpyderPluginWidget interface which allows different plugins and modules to be used very easily, further increasing variability.

It would seem that the codebase for Spyder can be easily used on many operating systems, not aimed at a specific one. However, there are pieces which account for specific operating system requirements such as "NT" assuming that most modern Windows systems are nicknamed NT by the Spyder Developers. This actually makes sense since most popular Windows releases are in fact "NT" releases. In any case, Spyder is compatible across Windows, MacOS, and Linux. So in terms of external variability, there is no issue here.

In terms of hardware variability, the rendering of complex graphs may depend on the speed of various hardware. This would depend mostly on CPU utilization, but it some cases, depending on the type of external kernel used to interpret use code, dedicated graphics hardware might come into play. There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to how Spyder will behave in various hardware, combined with whatever external kernel is used as well.

The following diagram outlines how the Spyder IDE achieves the requirements in the QAS for the Low Latency Dataset Graphing: 
 
A user wishes to graph a three-dimensional dataset at the Large Hadron Collider based on particle acceleration and collision. Since these datasets are notoriously very large, the user is skeptical that the graph will render quickly, but is happy to discover that data processing and rendering is relatively fast (H M).

## Rationale

The developers of Spyder seemed to have chosen the Publisher-Subscriber model in order to display results of code cell execution to its users. We believe that this was due in large part to the modular nature of the program; the code cells can be executed from many locations, which all emit (publish) the same signal in order to trigger functions across many co-operating modules. As more modules get added to the code codebase, triggering the execution of code cells may require the results of the execution to be available in many locations, and in an asynchronous way. A potentially large code cell may be executed, but the users of the program do not want the GUI to be blocked by synchronous execution. The publisher-subscriber model, while not a necessity for this case, turned out to be a good design decision. However, there may be complications in the future of the program due to the potential for "spaghetti" code which is part of the issue in the publisher-subscriber model. Due to the thin coupling of emitted signals and their (potentially multiple) connected functions, such a design pattern might be difficult to debug should issues arise. In addition, maintainers and future developers may have a difficult time figuring out what published emissions cause what behavior and when.

Although there are some potential issues with this particular style of publisher-subscriber implementation, it would seem that the underlying model which provides the cell-execution-and-results-display (like a rendered graph), can be easily replaced by a faster or more robust implementation. Indeed, the SpyderPluginWidget interface which provides communication between Spyder and any plugin module extensions such as the CodeEditor or ShellWidget sub-module plugin might be replaced should the current model prove too complicated or result in erroneous behavior.

A lower level analysis of the code which implements the run-code-to-rendered-image functionality, there seem to be issues with complexity, and poor variable naming. In many cases, there are functions named exactly the same thing which pass the formatted executable code along with a chain resulting from the initial broadcast of the GUI event (Run Cell) in question. In addition, the use of anonymous functions was utilized to trigger some events in the chain of execution as well. While we support the utilization of most features within a programming language, the use of anonymous functions is not always necessary. In this case, a combination of poor function naming and inappropriate use of a random anonymous lambda function nested within a complex chain of commands. While we acknowledge that anonymous functions should be utilized at times, at this point it seems superfluous. Looking at a specific use of this anonymous function within a narrow scope of analysis (not considering the functions in this call chain before and after it) the use seems appropriate. However, we submit that it was an inappropriate design in that one case. These issues will be discussed at more length in the next section (Milestone 5) as they appear to be examples of possible technical debt which could accumulate into confusion and poor maintainability in the future.

In summary, a publisher-subscriber style of design was utilized to provide code execution resulting in asynchronous image rendering in a code browser. In addition, the highly modular nature of Spyders architecture (heavily supported by the Spyder plugin widget interface) allows for relatively simple swapping and/or maintenance of modules deemed to have issues. The argument is not that the image rendering module is a problem at this point, but it is an example of how the publisher-subscriber style of design can lead to spaghetti code when in the wrong hands.

# Code Quality and Technical Debt

While writing software developers must frequently make design decisions about whether to write a piece of code the right way or the fast way. Sometimes the right way and the fast way are encompassed by the same solution. However, many times the right way to implement the solution proves to be slow and difficult. These decisions have implications for the future of the project that are frequently hard to predict. This is technical debt. Some of the most important aspects of a software development project have to do with code quality and technical debt. If code quality suffers, it can directly contribute to an accumulation of technical debt in terms of the time that will be required to refactor the project in the future should the code base become unmanageable, or if the direction of the project needs to change in a significant way that would require refactoring anyway. Technical debt is partly affected by code quality, but it is also affected by design decisions along the path of development. These design decisions can, many times, have unpredictable consequences for the future of the project. This part of the report serves to highlight an analysis of both code quality and the perceived technical debt of the Spyder IDE project.

## Code Quality Analysis Tools

In order to analyze the code quality of the Spyder base code, our team utilized both CodeScene and SonarQube. These tools provided information about hotspots, temporal coupling, code complexity, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and duplication. Many issues were found during the analysis of Spyder with both of these tools. While many of these issues do not cause the program to not function and are strictly to do with code style preference and code quality, many of them directly affect the estimation of technical debt for the project. If these issues are not addressed by the Spyder development team, it is possible that the technical debt could cause development to grind to a halt in the future. The following sections will outline the findings of the code quality tools, as well as the technical debt identified. In addition, the results of a manual search for specific keywords that might suggest technical debt will be discussed in the following sections.

See the [CodeScene](https://codescene.io/projects/4391/jobs/12332/results) instance for the full Spyder CodeScene analysis results().

See the [SonarQube](https://codescene.io/projects/4391/jobs/12332/results) instance for the full Spyder SonarQube analysis results.

### Code Scene

CodeScene is a tool with which one can analyze a software project in order to determine technical debt. The level of technical debt is determined by a number of quantitative values including, but not limited to, hotspots, and temporal coupling. CodeScene identifies patterns in your code's evolution. This gives a developer the power to predict the future of the project and to find code that is prone to defects. Investigation of the results of a CodeScene analysis is fast and helps to mitigate risks of future limitations such as bottlenecks and maintenance problems. The CodeScene team describes their tool as forensic software, and a way to improve the quality of code. CodeScene can also help to answer such questions as what kind of technical risk will be present when a key developer leaves a team, and what kind of knowledge and skill distribution might be present between teams working on different aspects of the code base. The Spyder IDE repository was analyzed using the CodeScene tool. The results showed a high level of complexity amongst modules directly related to the quality attribute scenarios that our team identified in previous milestones. Details of these findings are as follows [5.1]

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/codescene_summary.png?raw=true)

### Hotspots

Hotspots let a developer prioritize complicated code that they have to work with often and it shows where the most development time is spent as a percentage, and what percentages of bug fixes occur in those hotspots. Hotspots are calculated based on the code complexity and change frequency of individual files. The code complexity is based on if the hotspot has to be changed together with several other modules if the hotspot affects many different developers on different teams if the hotspot is likely to be a coordination bottleneck for multiple developers. CodeScene estimates that Spyder has 13.3% red hotspots. The red hot spots are the ones prioritized by CodeScene, and their analysis indicates that developers should spend the most time improving those hotspots for the most return on their time investment:

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/code_scene_hotspots.png?raw=true)

It would appear that not all of the hotspots identified by CodeScene are of any consequence to our analysis of the technical debt of the project, at least in terms of how they relate to the Quality Attribute services identified by our team. The hotspots which appear to be relevant to our analysis occur in mainwindow.py, languageserver.py, editor.plugin.py, editor.widgets.editor.py, editor.widgets.codeeditor.py, and plugins.ipythonconsole.plugin.py. Interestingly, these modules happen to make up the bulk of which elements were present and relevant in our previous views from milestone 3 and 4. This would suggest that, since it would be beneficial for developers to focus on these modules, then they would directly affect the quality attributes identified by our team.

Refactoring targets are used to prioritize the hotspots and to make it happen CodeScene employs algorithms that look at deeper change patterns in the analysis data. Refactoring targets shows all the main files which are more prone to tehnical debt, in the below figure we can see that CodeScene identifies mainwindow.py, editor.py, and codeeditor.py as being the most important refactoring targets:

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/code_scene_refactoring_targets.png?raw=true)

### Temporal Coupling

The temporal coupling analysis shows how two files change together over time. This means that during the editing of two files, they are committed to a repository within the same commit, or commits within a short period of time. These files are frequently seen to change together, indicating that they might be dependent on each other. The temporal coupling can be a serious code smell and can be useful to identify code duplication or tight coupling. That is, if two modules are interdependent, which is an unwanted attribute, temporal coupling information offers at least some insight into this. Not surprisingly, Spyder appears to have low temporal coupling. With regards to the relevant quality attributes discussed in previous milestones, it would appear that temporal couplings are nearly non-existent. The only relevant couplings have a degree of temporal coupling rated at 30%. This is between the editor and it's plugin class, editor.py:

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/code_scene_relevant_coupling.png?raw=true)

### SonarQube

SonarQube serves a similar purpose as CodeScene, but it provides a little more information in a different way. Some of the information that SonarQube provides includes Bugs and Vulnerabilities, Code Smells, and Duplication. SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities on 20+ programming languages. SonarQube offers reports on duplicated code, coding standards, unit tests, code coverage, code complexity, comments, bugs, and security vulnerabilities [5.3].

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/sonarqube_summary.png?raw=true)

### Bugs and Vulnerabilities

Bugs are basically the error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

The vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system.

SonarQube defines a bug as An issue that represents something wrong in the code. If this has not broken yet, it will, and probably at the worst possible moment. This needs to be fixed. Yesterday.[5.2]

The SonarQube analysis found 21 bugs and zero vulnerabilities. All but two of the bugs were classified as "major". Two were classified as minor bugs. None of the bugs listed by the analysis was present in any module that was related to the relevant quality attribute scenarios. Of all bugs found only 10 were present in Python or Javascript files. The majority of major bugs were found in the file jquery.js which is a Javascript element in the Spyder "Help" plugin. Spyder is written primarily in Python but does use Javascript in some of its modules. The remainder were HTML bugs that appear to be less of a concern than the core code since Spyder is a desktop application, not a web-based one:

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/sq_buglist_2.png?raw=true)

### Code Smells

SonarQube defined a code smell as A maintainability-related issue in the code. Leaving it as-is means that at best maintainers will have a harder time than they should make changes to the code. At worst, they'll be so confused by the state of the code that they'll introduce additional errors as they make changes.[5.2]. The result of the analysis reveals 600 code smells in total. Of these 600 code smells, 150 were critical, 233 were major, and 217 were minor classifications. An example of a major code smell classification very common in the Spyder code base is "Refactor this function to reduce its Cognitive Complexity from 87 to the 15 allowed". Cognitive complexity is a scoring system based on what SonarQube considers to be a characteristic of code that contributes in some small way to the overall complexity of a code file. For example, nesting a piece of code contributes +1 points to the complexity and each subsequent nesting within a nesting contributes +1 points as well. Instances of triple (or more) nesting are penalized even more. Deep nesting is considered by SonarQube to be undesirable coding practice. Another example of a code smell present in Spyder is exceeding the limit of the number of function parameters. The default analysis settings for SonarQube is 7 function parameters maximum, and many functions exceed this limit. There are too many types of code smells to summarize in this report, suffice to say that the estimated accumulated days of effort needed to refactor all of the suggested issues is 12 days.

### Duplication

Code duplication is generally regarded as an undesirable characteristic in a coding project. Code duplication means that, if the block of code duplicated has bugs, code smells, or technical debt, then the duplication of that code inherits all negative aspects, hence the undesirability. The SonarQube tool has identified approximately 0.7% of code duplication within the project, spread across 673 lines of duplicated code, 33 duplicated blocks, and 20 duplicated files. It should be noted that the modules with the largest proportion of duplication are the testing modules:

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/sq_duplicated_code.png?raw=true)

## Technical Debt Report

### Search for keywords in Github and Issues

We searched for "TODO" commenting in the Spyder code and noted the following distinct sections where it appeared that a "quick and dirty" implementation was being used rather than a proper implementation.

Here we see a comment, This may be inefficient, find a faster way to do it, indicating a solution that is likely to be slow, and could be replaced with a faster solution. Clearly, this code works for the overall solution for Spyder, but it becomes a processing bottleneck in the future. This is only a small trade-off, but it will lead to an accumulation of technical debt over time:

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/todo_sphinxify.png?raw=true)

The comment Remove hard coded "Value" column number (3 here) indicates that the function in this class cannot be dynamic according to passed in parameters. If many hardcoded values are utilized throughout the code in a similar manner then bugs may arise, leading to the requirement for future refactoring in order to make the column numbers parameterized. Hard coding parameters leads to a small accumulation of technical debt:

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/todo_collectionseditor.png?raw=true)

We see a comment, Add fallback to OSX as a TODO item within the code base. This suggests that the developer either did not have time to implement the fallback to OSX within the logical flow of the function, or they simply forgot to do so. If it was the first case, then the design decision for this portion indicates the accumulation of technical debt. This is because the developer may have been looking for a fast solution likely to work on whatever operating system the function was being developed on, but the design of that function for cross-platform compatibility was deferred:

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/todo_run_python_script_in_terminal.png?raw=true)

Of note, there are many comments "TODO: Connect this to the LSP!" within the Spyder code base in many plugin widget classes (the Language Server Protocol server provides Intellisense functionality). While some of these widgets do successfully connect to the LSP, some do not. Interestingly, recent bugs have arisen within the Spyder Github Issues forum mentioning that language recognition is not working on the SplitPane editor. We can see that technical debt is catching up to the recent versions of Spyder due to not implementing the LSP connections in all locations where there was a TODO comment:

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/todo_update_code_analysis_actions.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/Zhend/UVicDSA19/blob/master/images/Spyder/issues_lsp.png?raw=true)

A keyword search for "technical debt" in the Issues section of the Spyder Github page revealed an open issue which was a discussion about a roadmap to end support for Python 2 in future releases of Spyder due to a number of reasons including:

>> python2.7 support will end in 2020, some libraries are dropping python2 support (ipython), the majority of libraries already support Python 3, there is a big technical debt in spyder related to python2 support (the utility py3compat is used in +50 files), and the CI time will drop to almost half.

The response of the lead maintainer, Carlos Cardoba, confirmed that Spyder 5 will indeed be a Python 3 project, and acknowledged that the port will be a big job:

>> The problem is the big refactoring we're planning for Spyder 4 (and that now lives in the split-plugins branch) will make really, really hard to keep maintaining our 3 series with bugfixes until 2020. So we decided to leave Python 2 support in Spyder 4 and to release Spyder 5 at the end of 2019 with the single change of being Python 3 only.

The Spyder team has utilized Python 2 will the pycompat3 library up until now, but has made a decision to switch gears and move into Python 3 only support for a future version of Spyder (version 5) in 2020. This is a near textbook definition of technical debt. At the time Spyder was first released, it is possible that discussions about implementation in Python 2 were a non-issue because most external tools and libraries still used and supported Python 2. However, the clock is running down for Python 2 as it will no longer be supported in 2020. In addition, many of Spyder external modules are also dropping support for Python 2. A search in the Issues forums and discussion does not reveal the design decision for choosing Python 2 over 3 since 3 has been available since 2000 and Spyder development began around 2015. It is likely that the developers of Spyder in its early days did not consider their decision would result in an entire refactoring of the project at a later date. Either that or the refactoring was considered as a distinct possibility and the decision to use Python 2 was a conscious one so that a working version of the product could be implemented fast and with a lot of support from Python 2 only external modules. This is a typical example of a technical debt decision; a design or construction approach is taken that's expedient in the short term, but that creates a technical context that increases complexity and cost in the long term. Clearly, it is a complex task to refactor all Python 2 modules into Python 3 within a 200,000 KSLOC project, and the cost is certainly a factor.

## Summary of Findings

### CodeScene Analysis

It would appear that the only issues of interest identified in the CodeScene analysis were the identification of hotspots within Spyder. The temporal coupling data revealed only a small amount of coupling within modules of interest (those related to the identified quality attribute scenarios). However, the hotspots suggest a high degree of complexity in almost all of the modules of interest. This suggests that these modules need to be refactored, at least in a general sense, to reduce code complexity. That is, the functions should be shorter, with less nesting in order to increase readability and maintainability. Because of the high complexity in the modules of interest, the primary quality attributes which we identified as important will be directly affected in the future.

### SonarQube Analysis

From the bugs and vulnerabilities analysis, the most significant bug was a duplicated else if condition in the Spyder IDE Variable Explorer. Most likely, this bug leads to dead code, but there's a chance it could lead to unexpected behavior. The remaining bugs are within HTML files which seem inconsequential (since Spyder is a desktop application, not a web application), and within the Help plugin where there are a few items of the issue, but these bugs are within an arguably less important module. There are undoubtedly some code quality issues due to the bugs and vulnerability analysis.

There are a significant number of code smells within this project which sums to 12 days worth of refactoring. While these code smells are not necessarily project breaking issues, they are (by SonarQube's estimation) bad coding practice, and they should be refactored. Deeply nested functions, too many parameters, function length (too many lines), excessively large complexity scores, and other issues plague this project.

The duplications are clearly an issue if the duplicated code itself has an inherent bug. If that's the case, then all of the duplicated bugs needed to be fixed.

All of these issues aren't mission critical to Spyder's success or failure, but over time these refactoring issues could lead to a stall in development when maintainability becomes too cost-intensive because the complexity is too much for developer maintenance.

### Technical Debt

The code analysis tools estimated approximately 12 days of technical debt, or time required, in order to refactor the Spyder codebase into a form free of excessive complexity and code smells. The most interesting part of the technical debt analysis was derived from a manual check of the issues forum on the Spyder GitHub page. A number of issues were identified, but two were quite notable. The first of these issues was related to a bug where the Intellisense feature was not present on one of the Spyder widgets. This was due to an LSP (language server protocol) server bug. The LSP bug might have been predicted after a manual search through the code base for comments matching TODO since this search revealed many locations that put off connecting the LSP server to that portion of the code. The second notable issue had to do with a major design decision to migrate the entire Spyder code base from Python 2 to Python 3 in the 2019 release of Spyder version 5. This is certainly a potentially huge undertaking for the developer community since this is an open source project. Many of the developers may not be available or interested in contributing anymore, which leaves the original members (such as Carlos Cardoba and others) the sole responsibility of refactoring the entire project in a reasonable amount of time. The refactoring process may or may not have been predicted in the early days of the design of Spyder, but either way, it was undoubtedly a design decision which will have a significant impact on future project development. The second example is nearly a textbook definition of technical debt; it would seem that a major decision was made to use Python 2, possibly due to the availability of external modules that also used Python 2, in order to expedite the implementation of a working product. The tradeoff was a working product, but now the team faces paying the price by refactoring the entire code base.

### Other Notable Design Flaws

There is an inconsistent level of commenting throughout classes and functions. Some classes are commented quite extensively, but some are completely devoid of any comments. While some developers might argue that commenting is not necessary if functions and variables are named correctly, commenting does have it's place. Especially for new developers, or for speeding up the onboarding process for experienced developers who are new to the team. In addition, if there does not exist documentation for a project, a well-commented project can contribute to the accuracy of these documents by leaving less room for ambiguity or inaccurate interpretation of function or class behavior.

Some of the class files are 3 KSLOC which can be quite difficult to maintain or to determine the function of the class. Many of the classes are quite complex, as noted by a high level of complexity reported by CodeScene. This complexity is certainly palpable when attempting to intuit what the code actually does. In addition, there does not appear to be a code quality standard or style guide. Because of that, it seems that, as long as the code works, then style or complexity isn't a big deal. This causes an issue during the end to end function tracing, especially if some classes are over-engineered, and some are not, but both come from different developers.

### Conclusion 

The Spyder project certainly has it's issues. The behavior of the product, when installed and used in a normal fashion, suggests a stable and well-engineered product. However, an analysis of the code base using both automated tools, and a manual analysis reveals a significant amount of technical debt, and overly complicated code. These issues could be addressed by creating a coding style guideline, as well as a guideline for project contribution. It might also be helpful to run the automated tools on a regular basis in order to double check that the design is not going too far off the rails. While many issues can be addressed and prevented, some technical debt cannot be avoided.
