# Spyder: Scientific Python IDE
The documentation is written on Spyder IDE for SENG 480 instructed by Dr. Neil Ernst during the Winter 2019 semester at the University of Victoria, and is written by Arman Yousef Zadeh Shooshtari, Anna Olkhovskaia, ZoÃ« Henderson, Alex Deweert, and Nitika Jindal.

The Spyder Integrated Development Environment (Spyder) is an open source cross-platform development environment for scientific programming in the Python language. Spyder integrates with a number of prominent packages in the scientific Python stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, IPython, SymPy and Cython.

Spyder is a free and open source IDE first released in 2009. Previously known as "Pydee", the project started as a port of spyderlib, which is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. Spyder offers a unique combination of advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality. It is a comprehensive development tool with data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities. Beyond its many built-in features, its abilities can be extended even further via its plugin system and API. Furthermore, Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing developers to build upon its functionality and embed its components, such as the interactive console, in their own PyQt software.

This documentation will serve to highlight some of the key architectural features of Spyder which support some of the business drivers behind the Spyder Project. First, the documentation will highlight the key stakeholders of the project and their business goals. From these goals a list of architecturally significant requirements are derived, and then the quality attribute scenarios which detail quantitative measurements of how the architecturally significant requirements can be realized. A primary presentation of the overall architecture of Spyder, plus two interface diagrams, a context diagram, and two sequence diagrams will provide some insight into the operations of Spyder at both macro and micro levels of abstraction. Later, a component and connector diagram will provide even more detail into one of the key design decisions about how Spyder translates user GUI events into code execution and the subsequent display of rendered images. The component and connector view also provides another context diagram which summarizes the interaction between the Spyder CodeEditor and the external kernels which process code cells and update the image canvas for rendering. The documentation discusses how Spyder responds to variability in its environment, and to internal changes of architecture as well. Finally, the documentation attempts to analyze the rationale behind some of the key design decisions for the Spyder project.
